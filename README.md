# dotfiles
My dotfiles and scripts to make my life easier. Works on MacOSX and Linux (Debian and variants). Strongly inspired on [this](https://github.com/davidsonfellipe/dotfiles) project (Thanks Davidson!! :D)

## How can I use it?

```
$ ./dot -h
Usage: ./dot [options] <action> <module>

   <action> means: What do you want to do? (install or uninstall)
   <module> means: The folder to be installed/uninstalled

   Options:
   h      Print this help
   v      Enable verbose
